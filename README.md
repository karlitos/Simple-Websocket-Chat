I failed to use the provided wrapper and the WebSocket library. Whatever I tried, I was not able to send any messages to other connected clients, the server also sends the message only to the client, from which the message comes, no matter if array with connection Id's is provided or not. The documentation of the wrapper is very basic, but the client corresponds in my opinion to the example from the GitHub repository.

Also, I faced an issue, where the client every message. I found several complaints in the Internet, some of them related to the jQuery events. It was mentioned, that the WebSocket library should be not "thread-safe". Correcting tis would need some sever debugging of the provided wrapper.
